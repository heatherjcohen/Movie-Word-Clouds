               REVENGE OF THE JEDI...
               Luke Skywalker has returned to his home
               planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue
               his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the
               vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.

               Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC
               EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a
               new armored space station even more powerful
               than the first dreaded Death Star.

               When completed, this ultimate weapon will
               spell certain doom for the small band of
               Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the
               galaxy...
    
    
  
               Command station, this is ST 321. Code
               Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach.
               Deactivate the security shield. 
                              (filtered VO)
               The security deflector shield will be
               deactivated when we have confirmation of your
               code transmission. Stand by... You are clear
               to proceed. 
               We're starting our approach. 
    
  
               Inform the commander that Lord Vader's
               shuttle has arrived. 
               Yes, sir.
   
     
     
               Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
               We're honored by your presence. 
               You may dispense with the pleasantries,
               Commander. I'm here to put you back on
               schedule.
  
               I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working
               as fast as they can. 
               Perhaps I can find new ways to
               motivate them. 
               I tell you, this station will be operational
               as planned. 
               The Emperor does not share your
               optimistic appraisal of the situation. 
               But he asks the impossible. I need more men. 
               Then perhaps you can tell him when he
               arrives. 
               The Emperor's coming here? 
               That is correct, Commander. And he is most
               displeased with your apparent lack of
               progress. 
               We shall double our efforts. 
               I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The
               Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. 
      
               Of course I'm worried. And you should be,
               too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
               never returned from this awful place.
  
               Don't be so sure. If I told you half the
               things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt,
               You'd probably short-circuit.
  
               Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?
               I better knock, I suppose. 
   
               There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's
               go back and tell Master Luke.
    
               Tee chuta hhat yudd! 
               Goodness gracious me!
  
               Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd
               mischka Jabba du Hutt.
    
               I don't think they're going to let us in,
               Artoo. We'd better go.
    
   
               Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really
               don't think we should rush into all this.
  
               Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me! 
      
               Just you deliver Master Luke's message and
               get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.
   
               Die Wanna Wanga! 
               Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a
               message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.
  
               ... and a gift.
               (thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
               Gift, what gift?
  
               Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
    
               He says that our instructions are to give it
               only to Jabba himself.
  
               I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so
               stubborn about these sort of things.
  
               Nudd Chaa.
   
               Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. 
              
               Good morning. 
               Bo Shuda!
   
               The message, Artoo, the message.
     
               Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce
               myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and
               friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
               powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger
               with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an
               audience with Your Greatness to bargain for
               Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your
               wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an
               arrangement which will be mutually beneficial
               and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
               confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I
               present to you a gift: these two droids.
  
               What did he say? 
               ... Both are hardworking and will serve you
               well. 
               This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the
               wrong message.
 
  
               There will be no bargain. 
               We're doomed. 
               I will not give up my favorite decoration. I
               like Captain Solo where he is.
    
               Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still
               frozen in carbonite. 
      
               What could possibly have come over Master
               Luke. Is it something I did? He never
               expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh!
               Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
   
   
     (EVE-NINEDENINE). Behind the robot can be seen a torture rack      
               Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a
               protocol droid, are you not? 
               I am See-Threepio, human-cy... 
               Yes or no will do. 
               Oh. Well, yes. 
               How many languages do you speak? 
               I am fluent in over six million forms of
               communication, and can readily... 
               Splendid! We have been without an interpreter
               since our master got angry with our last
               protocol droid and disintegrated him. 
               Disintegrated? 
               Guard! This protocol droid might be useful.
               Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him
               back to His Excellency's main audience
               chamber.
  
               Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
   
               You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon
               learn some respect. I have need for you on
               the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll
               fit in nicely.
  
   
     
               Da Eitha!
  
               Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
  
               Boscka!
     
       
      
               I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee. 
               Oh, no! Chewbacca! 
               At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
   
               Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your
               Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!
    
               Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome
               and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-
               five thousand. 
               I want fifty thousand. No less.
      
               Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
               (to Boushh)
               Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay
               fifty thousand.
     
               Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
      
               This bounty hunter is my kind of scum.
               Fearless and inventive.
  
               Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I
               suggest you take it.
    
               Zeebuss. 
               He agrees!
      
     
      
   
    
    
     
         
     
               Just relax for a moment. You're free of the
               carbonite.
  
               Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. 
               I can't see. 
               You eyesight will return in time. 
               Where am I? 
               Jabba's palace. 
               Who are you?
   
               Someone who loves you. 
               Leia! 
               I gotta get you out of here.
    
               What's that? I know that laugh.
    
               Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way
               to pay you back, but I got a little
               sidetracked. It's not my fault.
  
               It's too late for that, Solo. You may have
               been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha
               fodder. 
               Look... 
               Take him away!
  
               Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing
               away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
   
               Bring her to me.
    
               We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret
               this... 
               I'm sure.
   
               Ugh! 
               Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. 
       
               Chewie? Chewie, is that you?
    
               Ah! Chew--Chewie!
  
               Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?
  
               Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care
               of himself, much less rescue anybody.
  
               A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a
               little while, everybody gets delusions of
               grandeur.
   
               I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. 
     
   
      
               I must speak with Jabba.
   
               You will take me to Jabba now!
   
               You serve your master well.
  
               And you will be rewarded. 
       
               At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. 
               Master.
  
               ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. 
               I told you not to admit him. 
               I must be allowed to speak. 
               He must be allowed to speak.
  
               You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi
               mind trick.
  
               You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee
               to me. 
               Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. 
               Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his
               friends. You can either profit by this... or
               be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn
               you not to underestimate my powers.
   
               Master Luke, you're standing on... 
               There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall
               enjoy watching you die.
    
               Bascka!
     
       
               Oh, no! The Rancor!
    
    
       
       
       
      
     
               Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all
               suffer for this outrage. 
    
   
               Han! 
               Luke! 
               Are you all right? 
               Fine. Together again, huh? 
               Wouldn't miss it. 
               How are we doing? 
               The same as always. 
               That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
  
               I'm here.
    
  
               Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great
               Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to
               be terminated immediately. 
               Good, I hate long waits. 
               You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea
               and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting
               place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. 
               Doesn't sound so bad. 
               In his belly, you will find a new definition
               of pain and suffering, as you are slowly
               digested over a thousand years. 
               On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
  
               You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the
               last mistake you'll ever make.
 
   
     
               I think my eyes are getting better. Instead
               of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. 
               There's nothing to see. I used to live here,
               you know. 
               You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. 
               Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've
               taken care of everything. 
               Oh... great! 
      
               Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
    
               Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you
               doing here?
  
               Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but
               this place is dangerous. They're going to
               execute Master Luke and, if we're not
               careful, us too!

              Artoo whistles a singsong response. 
               Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence. 
        
      
               Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His
               Excellency hopes that you will die honorably.
               But should any of you wish to beg for mercy,
               the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to
               your pleas. 
  
               Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of...
               worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure
               from us. Right?
  
               Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or
               die.
  
    
               Move him into position.
 
      
               Put him in. 
         
     
   
   
   
               Easy, Chewie.
     
               Whoa! Whoa! Help! 
   
    
    
               Chewie, you okay? Where is he?
  
               I'm okay, pal.
      
   
               Han! Chewie? 
               Lando!
     
    
   
  
               Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
  
      
         
    
               Lando, grab it! 
               Lower it! 
               I'm trying!
        
               Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.
    
               Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
        
      
               Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
   
               Hold it! Whoa!
  
               Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy.
               Hold me, Chewie.
   
               Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move,
               Lando. 
               No, wait! I thought you were blind! 
               It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. 
               All right! A little higher! Just a little
               higher!
    
               Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up,
               Chewie, up! 
        
     
               Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
    
               Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh!
               Ohhh! You beast!
  
     (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off. 
    
               Get the gun! Point it at the deck!
   
               Point it at the deck!
    
   
               Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't
               possibly jump.
  
   
               Come on!
    
   
               Let's go! And don't forget the droids. 
               We're on our way.
  
     
    
      
     
               I don't know. All I can see is a lot of
               blowing sand! 
               That's all any of us can see. 
               Then I guess I'm getting better.
     
               I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were
               pretty good out there. 
               I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it. 
               No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon
               freeze was the closest thing to dead there
               is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big
               wide awake nothing!
    
               I'll see you back at the fleet. 
               Why don't you leave that crate and come with
               us? 
               I have a promise I have to keep first... to
               an old friend.
  
               (looking dubiously at Lando, obviously
               remembering his friend's betrayal and
               subsequent aide)
               Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. 
               Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd
               just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so
               I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or
               later. 
               He means "You're welcome." 
               Come on, let's get off this miserable dust
               ball. 
    
    
               I'll meet you back at the fleet. 
               Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by
               now. 
               I will. 
               Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after
               me. Now I owe you one.
    
    
  
   
   
         
               Rise, my friend.
      
               The Death Star will be completed on schedule. 
               You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I
               sense you wish to continue your search for
               young Skywalker. 
               Yes, my Master. 
               Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you
               out. And when he does, you must bring him
               before me. He has grown strong. Only together
               can we turn him to the dark side of the
               Force. 
               As you wish. 
               Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
  
     
      
               Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to
               young eyes?
   
               No... of course not. 
               I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and
               weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine
               hundred years old you reach, look as good you
               will not. Hmm?
  
               Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned
               it, I have.
  
               Master Yoda, you can't die. 
               Strong am I with the Force... but not that
               strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night
               must fall. That is the way of things ... the
               way of the Force. 
               But I need your help. I've come back to
               complete the training. 
               No more training do you require. Already know
               you that which you need.
  
               Then I am a Jedi? 
               Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You
               must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi
               will you be. And confront him you will.
   
               Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
    
               Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
  
               Yoda, I must know. 
               Your father he is.
  
               Told you, did he? 
               Yes.
  
               Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... 
               Unfortunate that I know the truth?
  
               No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face
               him... that incomplete was your training. Not
               ready for the burden were you. 
               Well, I'm sorry. 
               Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the
               Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression.
               The dark side are they.  Once you start down
               the dark path, forever will it dominate your
               destiny.
  
               Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate
               the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your
               father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
               (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be.
               Luke, the Force runs strong in your family.
               Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with
               great effort) There is...
               another...Sky...Sky...walker.
   
     
               I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. 
               Yoda will always be with you.
  
               Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
  
               You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my
               father. 
               You father was seduced by the dark side of
               the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
               and became Darth Vader. When that happened,
               the good man who was your father was
               destroyed. So what I have told you was
               true... from a certain point of view. 
               A certain point of view! 
               Luke, you're going to find that many of the
               truths we cling to depend greatly on our own
               point of view.
  
               I don't blame you for being angry. If I was
               wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't
               have been for the first time. You see, what
               happened to your father was my fault.
  
               Anakin was a good friend.
    
               When I first knew him, your father was
               already a great pilot. But I was amazed how
               strongly the Force was with him.  I took it
               upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I
               thought that I could instruct him just as
               well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has
               had terrible consequences for the galaxy.
  
               There's still good in him. 
               I also thought he could be turned back to the
               good side. It couldn't be done. He is more
               machine now than man. Twisted and evil. 
               I can't do it, Ben. 
               You cannot escape your destiny. 
               I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. 
               Vader humbled you when first you met him,
               Luke...but that experience was part of your
               training. It taught you, among other things,
               the value of patience.  Had you not been so
               impatient to defeat Vader then, you could
               have finished your training here with Yoda.
               You would have been prepared. 
               But I had to help my friends. 
               And did you help them? It was they who had to
               save you. You achieved little by rushing back
               prematurely, I fear. 
               I found out Darth Vader was my father. 
               To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and
               then go beyond the dark side - the side your
               father couldn't get past. Impatience is
               the easiest door - for you, like your father.
               Only, your father was seduced by what he
               found on the other side of the door, and you
               have held firm. You're no longer so reckless
               now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And
               now, you must face Darth Vader again! 
               I can't kill my own father. 
               Then the Emperor has already won. You were
               our only hope. 
               Yoda spoke of another. 
               The other he spoke of is your twin sister. 
               But I have no sister. 
               Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor,
               you were hidden from your father when you
               were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if
               Anakin were to have any offspring, they would
               be a threat to him. That is the reason why
               your sister remains safely anonymous. 
               Leia! Leia's my sister. 
               Your insight serves you well. Bury your
               feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit.
               But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
  
               When your father left, he didn't know your
               mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew
               he would find out eventually, but we wanted
               to keep you both as safe as possible, for as
               long as possible.  So I took you to live with
               my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother
               took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator
               Organa, on Alderaan.
  
               The Organa household was high-born and
               politically quite powerful in that system.
               Leia became a princess by virtue of
               lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of
               course. But it was a title without real
               power, since Alderaan had long been a
               democracy.  Even so, the family continued to
               be politically powerful, and Leia, following
               in her foster father's path, became a senator
               as well.  That's not all she became, of
               course... she became the leader of her cell
               in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire.
               And because she had diplomatic immunity, she
               was a vital link for getting information to
               the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing
               when her path crossed yours... for her foster
               parents had always told her to contact me on
               Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.
   
               But you can't let her get involved now, Ben.
               Vader will destroy her. 
               She hasn't been trained in the ways of the
               Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force
               is strong with her, as it is with all of your
               family. There is no avoiding the battle. You
               must face and destroy Vader! 
    
     
      
  
               Well, look at you, a general, huh? 
               Oh, well, someone must have told them about
               my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. 
               Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you
               were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were
               lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy
               attack. 
               I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. 
               Well, who says they didn't.  But I
               ain't crazy. You're the respectable
               one, remember?
   
               The Emperor has made a critical error and the
               time for our attack has come.
    
               The data brought to us by the Bothan spies
               pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's
               new battle station. We also know that the
               weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet
               operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread
               throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to
               engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But
               most important of all, we've learned that the
               Emperor himself is personally overseeing the
               final stages of the construction of this
               Death Star.
   
               Many Bothans died to bring us this
               information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
   
               You can see here the Death Star orbiting the
               forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon
               systems on this Death Star are not yet
               operational, the Death Star does have a
               strong defense mechanism. It is protected by
               an energy shield, which is generated from the
               nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must
               be deactivated if any attack is to be
               attempted. Once the shield is down, our
               cruisers will create a perimeter, while the
               fighters fly into the superstructure and
               attempt to knock out the main reactor.
  
               General Calrissian has volunteered to lead
               the fighter attack
  
               Good luck.
  
               You're gonna need it. 
               General Madine.
  
               We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.
               Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret
               Imperial code, a strike team will land on the
               moon and deactivate the shield generator.
  
               Sounds dangerous. 
               I wonder who they found to pull that off. 
               General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
  
               Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command
               crew for the shuttle.
   
               Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want
               to speak for you.
  
               That's one. 
               Uh, General... count me in. 
               I'm with you, too!
   
   
               What is it? 
               Ask me again sometime.
   
               Luke. 
               Hi, Han... Chewie.
  
               "Exciting" is hardly the word I would use. 
        
               Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take
               her. You need all the help you can get. She's
               the fastest ship in the fleet. 
               All right, old buddy. You know, I know what
               she means to you. I'll take good care of her.
               She-she won't get a scratch. All right? 
               Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. 
               Look, would you get going, you pirate.
  
               Good luck. 
               You, too.
  
    
               You got her warmed? 
               Yeah, she's comin' up.
  
               No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in
               mind when they designed her, Chewie.
 
    
               Hey, are you awake? 
               Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm
               not gonna see her again.
   
               Come on, General, let's move.
  
               Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of
               junk can do. Ready, everybody? 
               All set. 
               Here we go again. 
               All right, hang on. 
   
    
     
               What is thy bidding, my Master? 
               Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.
               There it will stay until called for. 
               What of the reports of the Rebel fleet
               massing near Sullust? 
               It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will
               be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of
               us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go
               out to the command ship and await my orders. 
               Yes, my Master.
  
     
    
               If they don't go for this, we're gonna have
               to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.

               Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of
               the deflector shield. 
               Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code
               for shield passage. 
               Transmission commencing.
   
               Now we find out if that code is worth the
               price we paid. 
               It'll work. It'll work.
   
               Vader's on that ship. 
               Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot
               of command ships. Keep your distance though,
               Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to
               keep your distance.
  
               I don't know.  Fly casual. 
               I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have
               come. 
               It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's
               keep a little optimism here.
  
       
               Where is that shuttle going? 
               Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and
               destination? 
               Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
  
               Do they have a code clearance? 
               It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I
               was about to clear them.
  
               Shall I hold them? 
               No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them
               myself. 
               As you wish, my lord.
               (to controller) Carry on.
 
  
               They're not goin' for it, Chewie. 
               Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield
               will commence immediately. Follow your
               present course.
   
               Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No
               problem. 
  
  
    
    
               Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
    
               Shall we try and go around? 
               It'll take time. This whole party'll be for
               nothing if they see us.
  
   
               Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay
               here. 
               Quietly, there might be more of them out
               there. 
               Hey... it's me.
  
    
               Go for help! Go!
     
               Great. Come on.
     
               Over there! Two more of them! 
               I see them. Wait, Leia!
    
               Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
   
               Hey, wait! Ahhh!
 
     
               Move closer!
    
               Get alongside that one!
       
               Get him!
     
               Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
       
  
   
   
       
            
    
        
    
               Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
 
    
               Luke! Where's Leia? 
               What? She didn't come back? 
               I thought she was with you. 
               We got separated.
  
               Hey, we better go look for her.
  
               Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the
               shield generator at 0300. 
               Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
   
               Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to
               do.
  
               And you said it was pretty here. Ugh! 
       
    
               Cut it out!
  
               I'm not gonna hurt you.
    
               Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is,
               I don't know where here is.
    
               Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit
               down.
   
               I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
  
               All right. You want something to eat?
    
               That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
      
               Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you.
               Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't
               you?
     
               What is it?
         
               Freeze!  Come on, get up!
   
               Go get your ride and take her back to base. 
               Yes, sir.
             
               Come on, let's get outta here.
  
    
               Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be
               disturbed at the moment. 
               (raising his gloved hand to the two guards
               and choking them with the Force)
               The Emperor will see me, now! 
               (repeating Vader's command)
               The Emperor will see you, now. 
      
               I told you to remain on the command ship. 
               A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield
               and landed on Endor. 
               Yes, I know. 
               My son is with them. 
               Are you sure? 
               I have felt him, my Master. 
               Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your
               feelings on this matter are clear, Lord
               Vader.
  
               They are clear, my Master. 
               Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and
               wait for them. 
               He will come to me? 
               I have foreseen it. His compassion for you
               will be his undoing. He will come to you and
               then you will bring him before me. 
               As you wish.
 
     
               Luke! Luke!
   
               Oh, Master Luke. 
               There's two more wrecked speeders back there.
               And I found this.
  
               I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no
               trace of Princess Leia. 
               I hope she's alright.
   
               What, Chewie? What? Chewie!
  
    
               Hey, I don't get it.
  
               Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.
  
               Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!
       
               Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always
               thinking with your stomach. 
               Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out
               a way to get out of this thing. (trying to
               free an arm) Han, can you reach my
               lightsaber? 
               Yeah, sure.
     
               Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
               It's a very long dro-o-op!!
     
               Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace
               else.
     
               Hey! 
               Han, don't. It'll be all right.
    
               Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.
   
               Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
       
               Do you understand anything they're saying? 
               Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am
               fluent in over six million forms of
               communication. 
               What are you telling them? 
               Hello, I think... I could be mistaken.
               They're using a very primitive dialect.  But
               I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
   
               Well, why don't you use your divine influence
               and get us out of this? 
               I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that
               just wouldn't be proper. 
               Proper?! 
               It's against my programming to impersonate a
               deity.
  
               Why, you--
     
               My mistake. He's an old friend of mine. 
   
   
      
   
      
               I have a really bad feeling about this.
 
     
    
               What did he say? 
               I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it
               appears you are to be the main course at a
               banquet in my honor.
    
               Leia!
   
               Oh! 
               Your Royal Highness.
   
               But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them
               they must be set free.
      
               Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help
               us very much. 
               Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you
               wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. 
               But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't
               possibly -- 
               Just tell them.
    
               You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me.
               Just...
   
               ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's
               happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!
    
               Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo!
               Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo!
               Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh!
               Ohhh!
             
               Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. 
               Thanks, Threepio. 
               I...I never knew I had it in me. 
      
          
               Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
   
  
   
               What's going on? 
               I don't know.
    
               Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
  
               Just what I always wanted.
   
               Well, short help is better than no help at
               all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay. 
               He says the scouts are going to show us the
               quickest way to the shield generator.
   
               Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some
               fresh supplies, too. And try and get our
               weapons back.
  
               And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day. 
      
               Luke, what's wrong?
  
               Leia... do you remember your mother? Your
               real mother? 
               Just a little bit. She died when I was very
               young. 
               What do you remember? 
               Just...images, really. Feelings. 
               Tell me. 
               (a little surprised at his insistence)
               She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
               (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?
  
               I have no memory of my mother. I never knew
               her. 
               Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? 
               Vader is here...now, on this moon. 
               How do you know? 
               I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can
               feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.
               (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm
               endangering the group and our mission here.
               (beat) I have to face him.
  
               Why?
  
               He's my father. 
               Your father? 
               There's more. It won't be easy for you to
               hear it, but you must. If I don't make it
               back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
  
               Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power
               I--I don't understand and could never have. 
               You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too.
               In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The
               Force is strong in my family. My father has
               it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
   
               Yes. It's you Leia. 
               I know. Somehow...I've always known. 
               Then you know why I have to face him. 
               No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel
               your presence, then leave this place. I wish
               I could go with you. 
               No, you don't. You've always been strong. 
               But, why must you confront him? 
               Because...there is good in him. I've felt
               it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I
               can save him. I can turn him back to the good
               side. I have to try.
  
    
   
               Hey, what's goin' on?
  
               Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a
               little while. 
               Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?
  
               I...I can't tell you. 
               Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? 
               I... 
               Ahhh...
   
               I'm sorry. 
               Hold me.
 
  
   
      
               This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.
               Although he denies it, I believe there may be
               more of them, and I request permission to
               conduct a further search of the area.
  
               He was armed only with this.
   
               Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your
               s
