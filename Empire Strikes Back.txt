		THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK ...
		After the destruction of its
		most feared battle station, the
		Empire has declared martial law
		throughout the galaxy.

		A million worlds have felt the
		oppressive hand of the Emperor
		as He attempts to crush the
		growing rebellion.

		As the Imperial grip of tyranny
		tightens, Princess Leia and the
		small band of freedom fighters
		search for a more secure base of
		operations ...
  
   
     
   
    
    
  
 
			(to the Tauntaun)
		Easy girl, it's just another
		meteorite.
			(into com-link)
		Han ... Han ol' buddy, do you
		read me?
 
 
			(filtered)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
 
		I've finished my circle and I
		haven't picked up any life read-
		ings.
 
			(filtered)
		There isn't enough life on this
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
		My sentry markers are placed.
		I'm heading back to the base.
 
		I'll see you shortly.
		A meteorite just hit the ground
		near here and I want to check it
		out .. Won't be long. 
   
 
		Weeho, girl!  What's the matter
		... you smell something?  There's
		nothing out there.  I'll check
		again ...
    
 
		Son of a jumping ...!!!
    
    
   
      
   
          
 
		Cold isn't the word for it, Chewie.
		I'll take a good fight any day
		over all this hidin' and freezin'!
		... How you coming with those
		lifters?
 
 
		All right.  I'll go  report then
		I'll give you a hand with them.
		Soon as those lifters are fixed,
		we're out of here.
   
      
 
		Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
 
		There isn't a hint of life in
		the area.  But all the perimeter
		markers are set, so you'll know
		if anyone comes calling.
 
		Good, and Commander Skywalker?
 
		He's checking out a meteorite
		that hit near him. He'll be in
		soon.
 
			(indicates radar screen)
		With all the meteor activity in
		this system, it's going to be
		difficult to spot approaching
		ships.
 
		The Empire won't look for you out
		here.  I'd say you're all set ...
		which means it's time for me to
		get going.
 
		You're leaving?
    
 
		That's right.
 
		You're an extraordinary fighter.
		I hate to lose you.
 
		Thank you, General.  But there's
		a price on my head.  If I don't
		pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a 
		walking dead man.
 
		I understand.  A death mark is
		not an easy thing to live with ...
		Until our paths cross again,
		may the force be with you.
  
 
			(with feeling)
		I guess this is it, Your Highness.
  
 
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.
  
    
 

		Han!
 
 
		Yes, Your Highness?
 
		You said you were going to stay.
		What happened?
 
		That bounty hunter we ran into
		on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
 
		Does Luke know?
 
		He'll know when he gets back ...
		Don't give me that look.  Every
		day more bounty hunters are
		searching for me.  If I don't 
		pay off Jabba soon, there'll be
		too many to stop ... Remotes,
		Gank killers, and who knows what
		else.  I've got to get that price 
		off my head while I still have a head.
 
		Han, we need you here.
 
		We?
 
		Yes.
 
		Not you?
 
			(mystified)
		Me?  I don't know what you mean.
 
			(shakes his head, fed-up)
		You probably don't.  How could
		you?  You're so terrified of your
		own emotions ...
 
		And what are they, pray tell?
 
		You want me to stay because of
		the way you feel about me.
 
		I respect you.  You're a bold
		fighter, maybe not the brightest,
		but ... 
		No, your worship.. That's not
		what I'm talking about.
 
 
		You're imagining things.
   
 
		Am I?  I say you came running 
		after me because you were afraid 
		I was leaving you without even a
		kiss.
 
		I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
 
		There's no accounting for taste.
		Believe me, you could use a good
		kiss.
			(warming to the subject)
		You've spent so much time doing
		your duty and giving orders you've
		never learned how to be a woman.
		It's a shame, because you've got
		all the makings for one.  I could
		have helped you plenty in that
		department ... if you'd have let
		go for a minute.  But it's too
		late now, sweetheart.  Your big
		opportunity is flying out of here.
 
		We are fighting for a cause much ...
 
		Spare me please!  Don't tell me
		about the Rebellion again.  I've
		had it with your noble mission.
		All you let yourself think about
		is the Rebellion.  The result is
		you're as cold as this planet.
 
		And you think you're the one to
		apply some heat?
 
		Sure ... If I were interested.
		But I don't think it'd be much fun.
 
 
		We'll meet again.  Maybe you'll
		have grown up a little by then.
 
		You have all the breeding of a
		Bantha, but not as much class ...
		Enjoy your trip, hot shot!
  
    
 
    
    
    
  
        
   
 
			(to himself)
		Relax.  Relax.
      
 
		Luke, think the saber in your
		hand.
   
 
		Gotta relax, relax ....
 
		Let The Force flow, Luke.
          
   
      
 
		It is not my fault, you malfunc-
		tioning twerp.  I merely commented
		That it was freezing in her chamber.
		But it's supposed to be freezing.
		I did not ask you to turn on the 
		thermal heater. I don't know how
		we'll get all her things dried out
		... Ah. Here we are.
   
 
		Captain Solo, sir. Might I have
		a word with you?
 
		What is it?
 
		Mistress Leia has been trying to
		reach you on the communicator,
		but either you have it turned off,
		or it is malfunctioning ... if
		it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it,
		if you like.
 
		I shut it off.  What's her royal
		holiness want?
 
		She is looking for Master Luke,
		and assumed he would be here with
		you.  No one seems to know ...
   
 
			(concerned)
		Luke's not back yet?  It's almost 
		night out there!
 
 
		Bolt it down, Chewie ...
			(yelling)
		Deck Sergeant!
			(into com-link)
		Control, has Commander Skywalker
		reported in yet?
  
 
		Yes sir!
 
		Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker
		back yet?
 
		I haven't seen him.  He probably
		came in through the south entrance.
 
		Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant.
		Check on it!
  
 
		I don't know, Artoo.
			(to Han)
		Sir, might I inquire what's going
		on?
 
		Go tell your precious Princess ...
		Luke is dead unless he shows up
		soon.
 
 
		Oh no!  
     
 
			(to Deck Sergeant)
		... I can't imagine, sir.  Their
		necks are broken.
  
 
		Commander Skywalker hasn't come
		through the south entrance, sir.
		Maybe he slipped by without
		checking in.
 
		Not likely!  Where are the
		speeders?
 
		We haven't got them adapted to
		this cold yet ...
 
		We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
 
		The temperature is dropping too
		fast.
 
		You bet it is ... and Luke's out
		in it.
   
 
		The night storms will start before
		you can reach the first marker.
 
		Then I'll see you in Hell. 
     
         
  
    
  
     
 
		I can't ...
 
		You must.  Luke, look at me!
   
 
		You must survive, Luke.
 
		I'm cold ... so cold ...
 
		You must go to the Dagobah System
		... There you will learn from
		one who taught me:  Yoda, the
		Jedi Master.
 
		Ben ... Ben ...
 
		Luke ... you are the only hope.
  
 
		Ben!?
  
    
 
		Come on, buddy, you aren't dead
		yet.  Give me a sign here.
  
 
		Don't do this, Luke, it's not your
		time ...
 
 
		All right!  I knew you wouldn't
		leave me out here all alone!
  
 
			(to Luke)
		We've got to get you out of here
		before our transportation freezes. 
  
 
		Blast!  Deader than a Triton moon.
		We haven't got much time.
    
 
		I know this doesn't smell so good,
		Luke, but it'll keep you from 
		freezing.  I'm sure this Tauntaun
		wouldn't hesitate if it were the
		other way around.
			(Han gets an awful
				whiff of the insides)
		Whew!  It's just as well you're
		out, pal.
  
 
			(into com-link)
		Base one, do you copy? ...
		This com-link is useless.
   
 
		If I don't get this shelter up
		fast, Jabba the Hutt won't need 
		those bounty hunters. 
   
     
 
		Artoo can pick up no signals,
		although he feels his range is
		probably too limited to give up
		hope.
  
 
		Nothing more can be done tonight.
		The shield doors must be closed.
		I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
 
			(resigned)
		I understand.
  
 
		The speeders should be ready in
		the morning.  They'll make the
		search easier.
 
		Is there any chance of them
		surviving out there?
 
		Slim, but yes, there's a chance.
		They have a shelter.  It's not
		much, but ...
 
 
		Beggin' your pardon, ma'am, but
		Artoo says the chances of survival
		are one thousand, seven hundred
		twenty-seven to one.
			(to Artoo)
		Actually, I don't think we needed
		to know that.
     
      
   
   
 
			(excited)
		I've got something!  Not much but
		it could be a life form  FTC 2321
		by TRX 1173.  I'm closing in ... 
   
 
 
		This is S-122 calling Captain
		Solo, Commander Skywalker. Do
		you copy?  This is S-122 ...
 
 
			(filtered)
		Nice of you guys to drop by.  Hope
		we didn't get you up too early.
 
			(switching transmitters)
		Base One, I found them,  Repeat,
		I found them .... 
      
      
     
 
		Watch out ... snow creatures ...
		dangerous ... Yoda ... go to Yoda
		... only hope ... must survive ....
   
 
		He doesn't make sense to me either,
		Chewie.
 
		I do hope he's all there ... if
		you take my meaning.  I would hate
		to see Master Luke develop a short
		circuit ...
 
		The kid ran into something mean,
		and it wasn't the cold.
 
		Those creatures he keeps talking
		about ... we'd better double the
		security ... Han, I don't know
		how ...
 
		Forget it.
 
 
		He had gone into dormo-shock,
		almost hibernation.  But he's
		responding to the Bacta.  We'll
		bring him through.
  
 
		Now all we've got to worry about
		is what attacked him.
 
		No kidding.  If this snowball's
		got nasty natives, they could be 
		anywhere.
 
 
		That's right, Chewie, inside the
		base. 
          
    
        
      
 
		We got it, sir, but there may be
		more. 
    
 
		Have they analyzed the one that
		was killed?
 
		Not yet.  They're working on it
		now.
  
 
		General!
 
 
		It won't be long before our sensors
		will be able to track them.
 
		It figures Artoo would be in the 
		middle of this.
 
		It's going to be a little tricky
		around here until we know where
		they're coming form. 
  
 
		We have a visitor.
 
 
		We've picked up something outside
		the base in zone one, moving East.
 
		What is it?
 
		Can't tell yet ... Metal.
 
		Then it's not one of those creatures.
 
		Could it be one of ours?  A speeder?
 
		I'm getting no signal.  Wait,
		something very weak.
  
 
		I must say, sir, I'm fluent in
		over six million forms of communi-
		cation, but this is something new
		... must be in code or ....
 
 
		This is station five and we have
		your object on our scopes ...
		It's just over the ridge, we
		should have visual contact in
		about ... What the? ... Oh no!
 
 
		Whatever it is, it isn't friendly.
		I'm going to have a look.  Come on,
		Chewie.
 
		Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
 
			(over his shoulder)
		Fine.  But they'll have to take 
		care of themselves. 
   
     
  
    
      
    
 
 
			(filtered)
		.... I'm afraid there's not much
		left.
 
		What was it?
 
			(filtered)
		Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
		it that hard.  It must have had a
		self-destruct ....
 
		An Imperial probe droid.
 
			(filtered)
		Now don't panic.  We don't know
		that.
 
		But, we don't know it wasn't. 
      
         
 
		I think we've found them, Admiral.
 
		Are you sure, Captain?
 
		Well, the report we have is only 
		a fragment, from a probe droid in
		the Hoth System, but it's the best
		lead we've had in ....
 
			(angry)
		We have millions of probe droids
		searching the galaxy ... I want
		proof, not leads.  I don't intend
		to continue to chase around from
		one side ....
 
			(looming over the group)
		The Hoth System?
 
		Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ...
		the System is supposed to be devoid
		of human forms ...
    
 
		That's it.  That's the one.
 
		My Lord, how do you know it's
		them?  There are so many uncharted
		settlements.  It could be smugglers ...
 
		I know.  And I know young Skywalker
		is with them.  Bring in the patrol
		ships, Admiral, and set your course
		for the Hoth System.  General Veers
		prepare your men .... 
   
 
		... It seems the snow creatures
		are attracted to a high-pitched
		whistle.  That's how they're being
		drawn to this trap.
   
 
		See your whistles upset them.
		No, I told you they can't get out!
		Now will you hurry up?  I don't
		know why I bother ...
     
    
 
		The Bacta are growing well.  The
		scars should be gone in a day or
		so.  Does it still hurt?
 
		I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when
		I was out there and it looked 
		pretty bad ... well, it made me
		think about things.
 
		Me too.  I was afraid.
 
 
		I don't really know how to say this
		... I never have before ... Leia,
		you know how I feel about you ...
        
 
		Master Luke, it's so good to see
		you functional again.
 
		Thanks, Threepio.  Leia ...
 
 
		Artoo expresses his relief also.
 
		Good.  Thanks, Artoo.
 
			(about to leave)
		You rest now.
 
		So much has happened during the
		period of your indisposition, sir.
 
		I'll be back later.
 
			(anxious to keep her)
		Leia ... What would you think if
		I went away for a while?
 
		What did you say?!
   
 
		Where are you going?
 
		I have this ... feeling.  I'm
		not sure, really ...
 
		That's just great.  Why doesn't
		everyone just take off?
 
		What are you talking about?
 
		First Han, now you.  When am I
		going to learn not to count on
		anyone but myself? ...
 
		Han's leaving?
 

		... I was getting along just fine
		before I met you two moon jockeys.
 
		Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about
		Han.
 
		He wants to pay off that criminal
		he's in hock to.
 
		Jabba the Hutt?
 
			(back to her tirade)
		I could get more loyalty if I
		went down the hall and recruited
		some of those snow creatures.
 
		Snow creatures ... they're here?!
 
		Yes, sir.  But they're being trapped
		quite cleverly.
 
 
			(to Artoo)
		What do you mean, you took care
		of that?  I would hardly call your
		part in that matter great ...
  
 
		Hi kid, you look strong enough
		to wrestle a Gundark.
 
		Thanks to you.
 
		That's two you owe me, junior.
 
 
		Well, your worship, it looks like 
		you arranged to keep me close by
		for a while longer.
 
		I had nothing to do with it.  General
		Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any
		ships to leave the system until we
		know where that probe came from.
 
		Probe?  What probe?
 
		That makes a good story.  But I
		think you just can't bear to let
		me out of your sight.
 
		I don't know where you get your
		delusions, laser brains.
  
 
		Laugh it up, fuzz ball.  You didn't
		see her alone with me in the south
		passage.
 
 
			(to Luke)
		I don't know what he's talking
		about.
 
		Ooops!  I guess you haven't told
		Luke about that yet.
 
		About what?
 
		Now don't get the wrong idea, pal.
		She was just trying to express
		her true feelings for me.
 
			(to Han)
		You must have gone completely out
		of your feeble mind.
 
		Come on, your highness, are you
		telling me you haven't been thinking
		about that kiss?
 
 
		Why you low-down, stuck-up, half-
		witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
 
		Who's scruffy-looking?
			(a big grin)
		I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've
		hit pretty close to the mark to
		get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't
		it look that way to you, Luke?
 
			(staring at Leia)
		Yeah ... it does ... kind of.
  
 
		Oh it does, does it?  Well, I
		guess you don't understand every-
		thing about women yet ... do you,
		sonny?
    
  
   
        
 
		What is it, Veers?
 
		My Lord, the fleet has moved out
		of light speed.  Com-Scan has
		detected an energy field protecting
		an area on the sixth planet in the 
		Hoth System.  The field is strong
		enough to deflect any bombardment.
 
			(angry)
		The rebel scum is alerted to our
		presence.  I told Admiral Ozzel
		not to go out of light speed so
		close to the system.
 
		He felt surprise was a wiser ...
 
		He's as clumsy as he is stupid.
		A clean bombardment is impossible
		with that energy shield up.  Prepare
		your troops for a surface attack.
    
 
		Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
		out of light ...
 
		Captain Piett!
   
 
		Yes, My Lord.
 
		Make ready to land General Veers'
		assault troops on the surface.
		Then deploy the fleet so that
		nothing can get off that system.
		You're in command now, Admiral
		Piett.
    
       
 
		... the large transport ships will
		leave as soon as they've loaded.
		Only two fighter escorts per ship.
		The energy shield can only be 
		opened for a split second at a
		time, so you'll have to stay very 
		close to the transports.
 
		What about those Imperial ships
		out there?
 
		The ion cannon will fire two 
		blasts which will destroy any
		enemy ships in your flight path.
		Then proceed to the rendezvous
		point.  Good luck.
  
  
 
			(into com-link)
		All right, Chewie, give it a try.
       
 
			(into com-link)
		Hold it, Chewie. 
      
 
		Imperial assault craft have landed
		on the far side.
 
		If they reach the power generators,
		that will be the end of our energy
		shield.
 
		We must hold them off until all
		our ships are safely away.
 
		The first transport is ready ...
		Stand by to fire the ion cannon. 
    
   
 
		Sir ... rebel ship coming into
		our sector.
 
		Good, our first catch of the day.
		Close in .... 
    
 
		Our transport is approaching the
		shield.
 
		Open the shield and fire. 
   
     
      
       
      
 
		Looks like this'll be it for awhile.
		Chewie, take care of yourself ...
		and watch over this guy, will ya.
  
 
		I hope you make your peace with
		Jabba.
 
		Don't worry.  You haven't seen
		the last of us.
   
 
		Give Ôem hell, kid.
  
 
		First transport is clear and away.
   
 
		Are you feeling all right, sir?
 
		Like new, Dack.  How Ôbout you?
		Ready to try some real fighting?
 
		Yes, sir!  Right now I feel like
		I could take on the whole Empire
		myself.  You know what I mean,
		Commander?
 
			(quietly, strapping in)
		Yeah, I know ... I know.
 
 
		Speeder pilots ... Your fighters
		are being towed to the south slope.
		They should be safe there.  You'll 
		get a signal when the evacuation
		is complete. 
  
 
		Why is it when things seem to get
		settled, everything falls apart.
		Well, I guess it's goodbye then ...
		Take good care of Master Luke ...
		and take good care of yourself,
		too.  Until we meet again ....
    
    
     
   
    
       
     
    
    
  
 
     
    
 
		Incoming!  Open up ... they're
		point 03, Commander Skywalker
 
		We're on our way.
   
      
   
   
   
    
     
     
    
     
 
		Rogue Leader to Rogue Three.
 
		Copy, Rogue Leader. 
   
 
		Wedge, split your squad into pairs ... 
    
   
   
  
 
		On the right!
     
    
  
 
		That armor is too strong for 
		blasters. 
   
   
 
		Rogue Group use your harpoons and
		tow cables.  Go for the legs.  It's
		our only hope of stopping them.
		Hobbie, are you still with me? 
   
 
		Yes, sir.
 
		Well stick close now. 
      
  
 
		Whoea!  Luke, I can't seem to find
		my restraints ...
   
    
 
		Just hang on Dack, and get ready
		to fire that tow cable ....
   
    
 
		Stand by, Dack, we're almost
		there.  Are you okay, Dack? 
     
    
 
		Dack! 
     
   
 
    
   
   
    
    
 
		First chance we get, we're giving
		this crate a complete overhaul ...
		That's tight enough.  Let's get
		out of here before we become 
		permanent residents. 
  
 
		Two transports at a time is awfully
		risky.
 
		We have no choice.  Send them
		up ... and start clearing everyone
		out. 
     
 
		What's the range to the power
		generators?
 
		Six twenty one .... still too far
		out of range, but it won't be long. 
  
 
		We have that line of gun emplace-
		ments to get through ....
 
		No problem ....
  
 
		What's that? 
    
   
    
    
  
 
		Activate harpoon. 
   
  
  
 
		Cable out!  Let her go .... 
   
   
     
    
   
   
  
 
		Cable out! 
   
   
   
    
   
     
   
 
 
		Rogue Leader .... One down, Luke.
 
		I see it Wedge .... good work. 
      
    
    
      
    
     
    
 
		Steady, Rogue Two, I'll cover
		for you. 
   
 
		It's no good, I can't see.
 
		Steady, just keep it steady.
  
   
 
		I'll lead you in. 
   
 
		Is your gunner alright?
 
		I'm O.K., sir.
 
		Just keep it steady.  Don't try
		to ....
      
     
    
    
  
 
		Luke .... What happened, I can't ....
  
   
    
   
        
   
       
   
   
    
     
     
  
       
    
    
    
     
     
     
     
   
   
      
        
 
		I'm afraid he's no longer functioning.
  
 
			(urgent)
		The last transport is waiting.
 
 
		Beg your pardon, ma'am, but our
		possible avenues of exit are 
		being rapidly reduced.
  
 
		Tell the ship we're on our way,
		and signal the troops in the
		field to retreat to their fighters. 
       
 
		... I heard on the com-link the
		command station was destroyed.
		You all right?
 
 
		General Rieekan's dead.
 
 
		This all that's left of your unit?
		You'd better hurry, the transport's
		waiting for you. 
     
 
		That way is going to take too long.
		Let's go through these storage rooms.
 
 
		Hey!  Someone's still in here.
 
		Wait, don't open it ... that's one
		of the traps for the ice creatures.
 
 
		Oh my, there must be a hundred of
		them in there.
  
  
 
		I don't know if there's anyone
		left alive in there.  Give it one
		more try.
 
		Control unit 33, this is transport
		XJ ... we can't wait any longer .... 
 
 
		Hello, XJ!  They're coming now ...
   
  
 
		Transport XJ. get out of here.
		Go!
 
		The energy shield is down.  We'll
		be stuck here forever. 
    
   
  
 
		Disengage - Disengage - Ships away.
		Begin retreat action.
   
     
   
 
 
		All resistance is fading.
 
		Good, we have them now.  Prepare 
		to target the main generator. 
  
    
   
      
  
   
  
 
		.... yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached
		the main power generators and I'm
		destroying them now.  The shield
		will be down in moments.  You may
		start your landing ....
 
		Look out!
  
   
  
 
		He's going to ....
  
   
    
      
   
 
		... ships away.  Begin retreat
		action.  All troops begin retreat
		action.
   
       
     
   
 
		I couldn't get back any faster.
		It's pretty shaky out there.
  
 
		I know .... I know.  It's not good.
		But cheer up .... one way or another
		it will be over soon  
   
    
   
 
		How's that, Chewie?
 
 
		Would it help if I got out and
		pushed?
 
		Don't worry, your holiness, I'll
		get her started.
 
 
		Sir, I was wondering if I might ...
 
		It can wait.
 
 
		This bucket of bolts is never
		going to get us past that blockade.
 
		This baby's got a few surprises
		left in her.
 
		I'll be surprised if we ever start 
		moving.
   
   
 
		Well, I've tried everything, Chewie ....
		You'll just have to switch over,
		and hope for the best.
   
 
 
		Someday you're going to be wrong,
		and I just hope I'm there to see it.
 
 
		Punch it!
   
 
			(shouts)
		Chewie!
   
   
  
  
    
 
 
		We'll just have to switch over,
		and hope for the best.
     
 
		Someday you're going to be wrong,
		and I just hope I'm there to see it.
 
 
		Punch it!
     
    
    
     
  
  
 
		There goes the Falcon.  At least
		Han got away.  Wedge, that looks
		like yours over there.
 
		Right.  Good luck, Luke.
   
 
		Artoo, is that you?!
    
 
		Don't worry, we'll be airborne
		in a second.  Open the cockpit
		and activate the power. 
    
 
		Seventeen ships destroyed, we
		don't know how many got away.
 
		Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
 
		It won't get through the blockade.
 
		I want that ship.  
        
     
    
 
			(harried)
		I know, I know, I see them ... 
		See what?
 
		Two more Star Destroyers heading
		right at us.
 
		I'm glad you said there was going
		to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
 
 
		Sir, I was wondering ...
 
		Sit down, and shut up!
 
		It can wait. 
     
 
		Chewie, how's the deflector shield
		holding up?
 
 
		Good ... at sub-light, they may
		be faster, but we can still out-
		maneuver them.  Hold on! 
       
       
    
   
   
 
		Turn it!  Turn it! 
   
   
 
		That slowed them down a bit.  Chewie
		stand by to make the jump to light
		speed.
 
 
		They're getting awfully close ...
 
 
		Oh yeah ... Watch this. 
   
  
 
		Watch what?
 
 
		I think we're in trouble.
 
		If I may say so, Sir, I noticed
		earlier that the entire main para-
		light system seems to be damaged.
 
		We're in trouble!
   
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
  
  
 
		There's nothing wrong, Artoo.  I'm
		just setting a new course ...
			(Artoo beeps)
		No, we're not going to regroup
		with the others. 
   
 
 
		We're going to the Dagobah System.
			(Artoo beeps)
		We have enough power.
			(Artoo sing-songs
				a bit of chatter)
		They don't need us there.
			(Artoo beeps)
		I'm countermanding the order ...
		I'm a commander, remember.
   
 
		Yes, Artoo.
  
 
		Yes, Artoo, I know the Dagobah
		System doesn't appear on any of
		our navigational charts.  But,
		don't worry, it's there.
			(Artoo beeps a worried
				beep)
		I'm very sure .... trust me.
   
 
		Yes, Artoo?
			(a carefully-put sentence
				of whistles)
		No ... no headache, I feel fine
		... Why?
			(Artoo chirps an innocent
				phrase)
		No dizziness, no drowsiness, the
		scars are even gone ...
			(Artoo whistles a question)
		No, that's all right. Artoo, I'd
		rather keep it on manual control
		for awhile.
  
 
		Trust me, Artoo.  I know where I'm
		going and I'll get us there safely ...
		it's not far.  
     
   
  
 
		Horizontal booster ....
			(Chewie barks)
		Alluvial damper ....
			(Chewie barks)
		I don't know how we're going to
		get out of this one.
 
 
		I didn't say anything ....
  
 
		That was no laser blast .... some-
		thing hit us ....
 
		Or you ran into something .... 
   
  
 
		Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left,
		let's find out where they're
		coming from ...
 
		Probably an asteroid field ....
 
		Let's hope so ... it's just the
		chance we need.
 
		To get killed ... you're not
		seriously going into an asteroid 
		field?
 
		Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart.
		We're gonna do some flyin'.
 
 
		You don't have to do this to 
		impress me.
 
		If I might remind you, sir, the
		probability of successfully navi-
		gating through an asteroid field
		is approximately 365,000 to one
		... a graceful surrender might 
		not be ...
   
      
             
        
     
  
 
		My lord.
 
		Come in, Admiral.
  
        
 
		Our pursuit ships have sighted the
		Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It
		has entered an asteroid field.
 
		Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral.
		I want that ship, not excuses.  How
		long until you can have Skywalker
		and the others in the Millennium
		Falcon before me?
 
			(worried)
		Soon, Lord Vader.
 
			(ominous)
		Yes, Admiral .... soon. 
       
    
      
   
   
      
 
		Well, you said you wanted to be
		there when I was wrong.
 
		I take it back.
 
		That Star Destroyer is slowing
		down.
 
		Good. 
  
 
		But we're going to get pulverized
		if we stay out here much longer.
 
		I'm against that.
 
		We've got to get out of this shower.
 
		Now you're making sense.
 
		Right.  I'm going to get in closer
		to one of these big ones ...
 
		Closer?!
 
		Closer?!
  
    
       
    
    
   
  
 
		Look out. 
   
        
  
 
		There, there.  Chewie get a
		reading on that.  Looks pretty
		good.
 
		What is it?
 
		That should do nicely. 
   
   
       
   
   
  
  
 
		Yes, that's Dagobah, Artoo ... looks
		a little grim doesn't it ...
			(Artoo beeps)
		... No, I don't want to change my
		mind about this ... I'm not picking
		up any cities or technology ...
			(a little nervous)
		... Massive life form readings though.
		There's something alive down there ...
			(Artoo beeps a worried query)
		... Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly
		safe for droids.  Will you take it
		easy? ... I guess I imagined that
		landing beacon.  We'll just have to
		go in and see what happens.
			(Artoo whimpers)
		Don't worry! 
   
   
   
    
 
		I know, I know!  All the scopes
		are dead!  I can't see a thing ....
		Hang on, I'm going to start the
		landing cycle .... Let's just
		hope there's something underneath
		us ....
       
 
		Yeah, I'm all right .... You still
		in one piece?
			(CLOSE-UP Artoo beeps
				affirmative)
		Good.  Come on, I think we're
		sinking.
  
      
 
		Artoo, I wonder if that water is
		safe?
  
 
		Artoo! 
       
    
    
 
		Hurry, Artoo! 
         
 
		Artoo, are you okay?
 
 
		If you said you thought coming
		here was a bad idea, I'm beginning
		to agree with you. 
        
 
		I'm sorry Artoo, I can't explain
		the urge that made me come here.
		It was part of a dream .... or
		.... maybe I'm just going crazy. 
  
  
 
		How are we going to get that thing
		flying again?  What am I doing here?
  
      
  
          
 
		.... which was the last time they
		appeared in any of our scopes.
		Considering the amount of damage
		we've sustained, they must have
		been destroyed ....
 
		They're alive, Captain.  I know
		it and I want every ship available
		to sweep the asteroid field until
		they're found.
  
 
		Now what's so important it couldn't
		wait, Admiral?  Speak up!
 
 
		It was .... the Emperor ....
 
		The Emperor?
 
		Yes, he commands you make contact
		with him ....
 
		Move this ship out of the asteroid
		field and into a position where we
		can send a clear transmission.
 
		Yes, My Lord.
 
		And code the signal to my private
		chamber. 
    
    
 
		Getting kinda romantic in here.
  
 
			(to Chewie)
		What are you so grouchy about?
 
		Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but
		does shutting down all but emergency
		power systems include me?
 
 
		No, we're going to need you to
		talk to the ship and find out what
		happened to our hyperdrive ...
		How good are you with a macrofuser,
		Your Holiness?
  
 
		A tremor!
 
			(to Han)
		Sir, it's very possible this
		asteroid is not stable.
 
		I'm glad you're here to tell us
		these things ...
 
 
		Hang on!  Watch out.
     
 
		Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
 
		Very funny.  You can let go now
		.... I'm getting angry.
 
		You don't look angry.
 
		How do I look?
 
			(with feeling)
		Beautiful.
  
 
		And excited.
 
 
		Sorry, Captain, being held by you
		isn't enough to get me excited.
 
		Well, I hope you don't expect more.
 
		I don't expect anything, except to 
		be left alone.
 
		Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll
		have to let go.
    
 
		Don't you think it's time we got
		to work on your ship ...
   
 
		Come on, Chewie, let's tear into
		this flying short circuit before
		we get hit with another tremor.
 
 
		You, too, golden rod.
 
		I must admit there are times I 
		don't understand human behavior. 
      
 
		I think that will do it, Artoo.
		Come on back.
         
 
		You ready for some power?
     
 
		Now all I have to do is find this
		Yoda .... if he even exists.
   
 
		This seems like a strange place 
		to find a Jedi master ... Gives
		me the creeps.
			(Artoo beeps ÒI'm with youÓ)
		... There's something familiar 
		about this place ... I feel like ...
 
		You feel like what?
      
 
			(looking at creature)
		... Like we're being watched.
 
		Away put your weapon.  I mean you
		no harm.
   
 
		I'm wondering ... why are you
		here?
 
		I'm looking for someone.
 
		Looking?  Looking?  You've found
		someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
 
			(trying to keep from smiling)
		Yeah ...
 
		Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
 
		I'm looking for a great warrior.
 
		A great warrior?
			(shakes his head)
		Not many on those.  Wars don't
		make one great.
  
 
		Get away from there.
   
  
 
		Hey, that's my dinner!
  
 
		Peewh!  Awful, awful.  Thank you,
		no.  How get you so big eating
		food of this kind?
  
 
		Listen, friend, we didn't mean
		to land here, and if I could get 
		my fighter out of this puddle I 
		would, but I can't.  So ...
 
		Can't get your ship out?  Have
		you tried?  Have you tried?
    
 
		Give me that!
 
			(retreating with it)
		Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you
		not.
     
 
		I don't want your help.  I want
		my lamp back.  I'll need it in
		this slimy mudhole.
 
		Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
   
 
		Beeps a few Ògimme thats.Ó
 
		Mine, mine.  Give it back.
  
 
 
		Mine, mine.
 
			(fed up)
		Okay, Artoo, let him have it.
		Now get out of here, little
		fellow, we've got things to do.
 
		No, no!  I'll stay and help you
		find your friend.
 
		I'm not looking for a friend.
		I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
 
		Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different
		altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
 
			(surprised and skeptical)
		You know the Jedi Master?
 
		Of course, yes.  But now eat we
		must.  Good food, I have good
		food.  Come, come.
    
 
			(quite upset)
		Whistles a blue streak.
 
			(to Artoo)
		You'd better stay here and watch 
		over the camp.
 
		Beeps even more frantically.
 
 
		Artoo, now settle down ... I can
		take care of myself ... I'll be
		safe ... okay?
   
 
 
		Heh ... safe ... heh ...
		quite safe (laughs) ... yes, of
		course. 
   
    
 
		Sate Pestage, I would see the 
		Emperor.  He commands it.
 
		I must warn you, Lord Vader,
		The Emperor is in a foul mood.
		He bids you wait.  Have you any
		progress to report?
 
		The rebel base on Hoth has been 
		destroyed.  I am tracking down
		the survivors.
 
		The Emperor will be with you in
		time.
 
		I wait at his convenience. 
     
    
         
 
		That was no earthquake.
 
		Felt like a hydro concussion ...
		an Imperial Cruiser.
 
		Oh my, they've found us.
  
 
		They're moving away.
 
		They're just trying to see if
		they can stir something up ...
		we're safe.
 
		Where have I heard that before?
      
 
		Where is Artoo when I need him?
		I don't know where your ship
		learned to communicate, but its
		dialect leaves something to be
		desired.  It says the power
		coupling on the negative axis has
		been polarized.  You'll have to
		replace it, I'm afraid.
 
		Barks his understanding and
		returns to his wires.
     
 
		Easy, your worship.  Only trying
		to help.
 
			(still struggling)
		Would you please stop calling 
		me that?
  
 
		Sure.  I guess I make it difficult
		sometimes.
 
		Yes, you do.
 
		You could be a touch warmer,
		though.
			(he watches her reaction)
		Admit it, against your better
		judgment you think I'm all right.
 
 
			(a little smile, haltingly)
		Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally,
		when you aren't acting like a
		scoundrel.
 
			(laughs)
		That's quite a compliment.
  
 
		Stop that.
 
		Why?
 
 
		My hands are dirty.
   
 
		What are you afraid of?
 
		Afraid of?  Certainly not you
		Captain Solo ... or any other
		man in this galaxy.
     
 
		Then why are you trembling?
   
 
		You know what I think?  I think
		you like me because I'm a scoundrel.
		I think you haven't run into enough
		scoundrels in your life.
    
 
		Don't count on it.  I happen to
		like nice men.
 
		Sure, they're safer.  You always
		know what they're going to do.
		Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
 
		There's nothing dull about a man
		I can depend on to be civilized.
 
		You mean a man you can control.
 
		I do not!
 
		Try and control this ...
      
 
		You're wrong ... This isn't what ...
			(he begins to kiss her again)
		... not what I .... want ....
        
   
 
		Chewie!  Gimme a hand with this. 
         
     
     
        
 
		... I told you, I'm not hungry.
 
		Patience.  It's time to eat.
 
		Look, it smells good.  I'm sure
		it's delicious   But I don't 
		know why we can't see Yoda now.
 
		It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
 
		Will it take long to get there?
		How far away is he?
 
		Not far, not far.  Be patient.
		Soon you will see him.  Why wish
		you become a Jedi?
 
		Because of my father, I guess.
 
			(placing food on the table)
		Oh, your father ... a powerful
		Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
 
			(a little angry)
		How could you know my father?
		You don't even know who I am.
			(fed-up)
		Can't we get on with this already?
  
 
			(irritated)
		No good is this.  This will not
		do.  I cannot teach him.  The
		boy has no patience!
  
 
		Ben!
    
 
		He will learn patience.
 
		Much anger in him, like in his
		father.
 
		We've discussed this before.
 
		I can be a Jedi.  I'm ready.
 
 
		Ready are you?  What know you of
		ready?  I have trained Jedi for
		800 years.  My own counsel I'll 
		keep on who is to be trained.
 
		Why not me?
 
		To become a Jedi takes the deepest
		commitment, the most serious mind.
 
		He can do it.
 
			(to Ben, indicating Luke)
		This one I have watched a long
		time.  All his life has he looked
		away ... to the horizon, to the
		sky, to the future.  Never his
		mind on where he was, on what he
		was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...
			(turning to Luke)
		A Jedi craves not these things!
 
 
		I have followed my feelings.
 
		You are reckless!
 
		He'll learn.
 
		He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to
		start the training.
 
 
		But it hasn't been wasted time.
		I've learned much already.
     
 
		Will he finish what he begins?
 
		We've come this far ... He is our
		only hope.
   
 
		I will not fail you.  I'm not
		afraid.
 
			(turns slowly toward him)
		You will be, my young one.  Heh.
		You will be. 
   
   
     
 
		You may rise, my servant.
  
 
		What is thy bidding, My Master?
 
		There is a grave disturbance in
		The Force.
 
		I have felt it.
 
		Our situation is most precarious.
		We have a new enemy who could
		bring about our destruction.
 
		Our destruction?  Who?
 
		The son of Skywalker.  You must
		destroy him ... or he will be
		our undoing.
 
		He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy.
		Obi-wan could not have taught him
		so much that ...
 
		You are weak!  I have seen it.
		The Force is strong with him.
		He must be destroyed.
 
		But, if he could be turned, he
		would be a powerful ally.
 
			(a long pause)
		Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
 
		He will join us or die, My Master.
   
    
     
        
   
    
 
		Everything checks out here.  If
		I might say so, I believe that
		should do it.
  
 
		There's something out there!
 
		Where?
 
		Outside, in the cave.
  
 
		It sounds like it's trying to get
		in.
 
		I'm going to see what it is.
 
		Are you crazy!
 
		Look, we just got this bucket
		going again.  I'm not about to
		let some varmint tear it apart ...
  
 
		If there's more than one, you're
		going to need help.
 
 
		But that leaves me here all alone!

		There will be more of them.  They

		Just what we need right now.
 
 
		This asteroid has the strangest 
		consistency ... Look at the ground,
		it's not like rock at all.
   
 
		There's an awful lot of moisture
		in here.
   
 
		I was afraid of that,
   
  
 
		Chewie, fire her up!  We're 
		getting out of here.
   
 
		It's just another tremor the 
		Empire is still out there.  I 
		don't think it's safe to.
 
 
		There's no time to discuss this 
		in committee.
   
 
			(angry)
		I am not a committee! 
  
 
		Those Star Destroyers will spot us 
		long before you can get into light
		speed.  You can't make the jump in 
		this asteroid field.
 
		Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're 
		taking off!
 
		But the tremors have stopped.
    
     
 
 
		I see it Chewie, hang on.
 
		The entrance is collapsing!
 
		We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress
		Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
 
		Not collapsing, honey.  It's
		closing!  This is no cave ...
 
		What??
 
		Oh my, no!
   
 
		Bank, Chewie!

		So sure are you?  Tried have you?

		Master, moving rocks is one thing,

			(irritated)
		No!  No different!  The differences

		No longer of use are they to you.
 
			(focusing, quietly)
		Okay.  I'll give it a try.
 
		No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not.
		There is no try.
 
 
  
 
 
		I can't. It's too big.
 
		Size has no meaning.  It matters
		not.  Look at me.  Judge me by

		And well you shouldn't.  For my
		ally is The Force.  And a powerful
		ally it is.  All of life feeds it
		and makes it grow.  Its energy
		surrounds us and binds us.  Luminous 
		beings are we ...
			(Yoda pinches Luke's skin)
		... not this crude matter.
			(a sweeping gesture)
		Feel it you must.  Feel the flow.
		Feel The Force around you ...
			(gesturing)
		... Here, between you and I and
		that tree and that rock ...
  
 
		... Yes, everywhere, waiting to
		be felt and used ... Yes, even
		between this land and that ship! 
    
  
 
		I don't believe it.
 
		That is why you fail. 
   
 
    
 
		Bounty hunters!  Why should he
		bring them into this?  The rebels
		won't escape us ....
 
 
		Sir, we have a priority signal
		from the Star Destroyer Vengeful.
       
 
		.... there will be a substantial
		reward for the one who finds the
		Millennium Falcon.  You are free
		to use any methods necessary, but
		I want proof ... no disintegrations.
  
 
		My Lord, we have them! 
          
   
    
 
		I can see the edge of the asteroid 
		field, sir.
 
		Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll
		kick this baby into hyperdrive. 
    
     
      
 
 
		I'm with you, Chewie.  Let's
		vacate the area.  Stand-by for
		light speed.  This time they get
		the surprise.  Hang on .... 
    
 
 
		This isn't fair!
   
 
			(sheepish on the defensive)
		Couldn't be, I checked the transfer
		circuits, just like you said!
			(Chewie barks)
		I tell you this time it's not my
		fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
 
			(almost expecting it)
		No lightspeed?
 
		It's not my fault.  I can't under-
		stand it!
 
		Sir, we've lost the rear deflector
		shield.  One more direct hit on
		the back quarter and we're done for.
 
		Well, what now?
  
 
		Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn
		this bucket around.
			(Chewie puzzled, barks)
		You heard me, turn around!  Full
		power on the front shield.
 
		You're going to attack them?!!!
 
		Sir, if I might point out, the
		odds of surviving a direct assault 
		on an Imperial Star Destroyer are ...
  
   
    
    
     
  
    
 
		He's coming in too low to hit!
 
		We're going to collide!
 
		Shields up?  He's insane!
 
		Look out!  
    
 
		Track them, they may come around
		for another pass.
 
		That's strange.
 
		What is it?
 
		The ship doesn't appear on any of
		our scopes.
 
		It couldn't have disappeared ...
		Could a ship that small have a
		cloaking device?
 
		No, sir ... Maybe they went into 
		light speed at the last minute.
 
		Then why did they attack?  They
		could have gone into hyperspace
		when they cleared the asteroid
		field.
 
		Well, there's no trace of them,
		sir, no matter how they did it.
		The only logical explanation is
		that they went into lightspeed ....
 
		Sir, Lord Vader demands an update
		on the pursuit .... What should
		he be told?
 
 
		I am responsible for this.  Get
		the shuttle ready.  When we rendezvous
		with Lord Vader, I will apologize to
		him myself ... Turn around and
		scan the area one more time. 
         
       
 
			(jovial)
		Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
 
			(pissed)
		I thought those seekers were set
		for stun!
 
		That they are.
 
		They're a lot stronger than I'm 
		used to.
 
		That would matter not were The
		Force flowing through you.  Higher 
		you'd jump!  Faster you'd move!
		Open yourself to The Force you must.
  
 
		I'm open to it now!  I feel it.
		Come on you little flying blasters!
   
 
		No, no.  This will not do.  Anger
		is what you feel.
 
		But I feel The Force flowing!
 
		Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark
		side of The Force are they.  Easily
		they flow ... quick to join you in
		a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of
		them.  A heavy price is paid for the
		power they bring.
 
 
		Price?  What do you mean?
 
		The dark side beckons.  But if
		once start down the dark path,
		forever will it dominate your
		destiny.  Consume you it will ...
		as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
 
		Lord Vader ... Is the dark side
		stronger?
 
		No, no.  Easier, quicker, more
		seductive.
 
		But how am I to know the good
		side from the dark?
 
		You will know.  When you are at
		peace ... calm ... passive.  A
		Jedi uses The Force for knowledge
		and defense.  Never for attack.
 
		But tell me why ...
 
		No!  Nothing more will I tell you
		now. Clear your mind of questions
		... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
 
 
		... Yes ... calm ...
 
 
			(soothing)
		... passive ... Let yourself go ...
      
    
 
		Much progress do you make, young
		one.  Stronger do you grow.
     
   
    
 
		Lord Vader, our ships have completed
		their scan of the area and found
		nothing.  The Millennium Falcon
		definitely went into lightspeed.
		It's probably on the other side
		of the galaxy by now.
 
		Alert all commands.  Calculate every
		possible destination along their
		last known trajectory and disburse
		the fleet to search for them.  Don't
		fail me again, Admiral, I've had
		quite enough!
 
		Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
  
 
		Deploy the fleet. 
     
   
 
  
 
		You could have warned him before
		you shut him off.
 
		Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to
		offend your droid.  You think
		braking and shutting down in
		that amount of time is easy?
 
		I'm still not sure what you've 
		accomplished.
 
		Chewie, check the manual release
		on the landing claws.
  
 
		What'd you have in mind for your
		next move?
 
			(pointing out window)
		The fleet is finally breaking up.
		I'm hoping they'll follow standard
		Imperial procedure and dump their
		garbage before they go into light
		speed.
  
 
		Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then
		what?
 
		Then we have to find a safe port
		around here.  Got any ideas?
 
		That depends.  Where are we?
 
		Here ... near the Anoat system.
    
 
		Funny, I have the feeling I've 
		been in this area before.  Let
		me check my logs.
 
		You keep logs?  My, how organized.
 
		Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I
		knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
 
		Never heard of that system.
 
		Lando's not a system, he's a man.
		A gambler, con-artist ... all-
		around scoundrel ...
			(winks at Leia)
		... your kind of guy.  The system
		is called Bespin.  It's a ways
		from here, but reachable.
 
			(reading from the computer)
		A mining colony.
 
		A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it
		in a sabacc match, or so he claims.
		Lando and I go way back.
 
		Can you trust him?
 
		No.  But he has no love for the
		Empire, that much I know ...
   
 
		I see it, Chewie, I see it ...
		Prepare the manual release.
			(turns to Leia)
		Here goes nothing, sweetheart.
   
 
		You do have your moments ... Not
		many, but you do have them.
 
		Let Ôer go, Chewie. 
     
     
    
    
 
		Four this time!  The Force you 
		feel.
 
		Yes ... I also feel danger ...
		death.  Something's not right.
     
 
		You brought me here purposely.
 
 
		I feel cold.
 
		This tree is strong with the dark
		side of The Force.  A servant of
		evil it is.  Into it you must go.
 
		What's in there?
 
		Only what you take with you.
  
 
		Your weapon ... you won't need it.
    
         
    
     
       
  
  
   
    
    
    
      
    
 
		No ... I do not have a landing
		permit ... my registration is
		... (static) ... 
  
 
		Standing by ... any aggressive move
		will bring about your destruction.
 
		Rather touchy, aren't they.
 
		I thought you knew this person.
 
		Well, it's been awhile.
 
		Barks and growls at his boss.
 
		That was a long time ago.  I'm
		sure he's forgotten all about it,
		and so should you.
 
		Permission granted to land on
		platform 327 ... any deviation
		of flight pattern will bring
		about your ...
   
 
		He'll help us ... We go way back ...
		really.  Don't worry.
 
 
		Who's worried? 
       
   
    
         
     
 
			(to Han, low)
		I don't like this.
 
			(uncertain)
		It'll be all right.  Trust me.
			(pause)
		And keep your eyes open.  You
		wait here.
     
 
		Why you slimy, double-crossing
		no-good swindler ... am I glad
		to see you.
 
			(skeptical)
		No hard feelings?
 
		Are you kidding?
 
		I always said you were a gentleman.
 
		I'll bet.
 
 
		How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still
		wasting your time with this clown,
		eh?
 
		Growls a reserved greeting.
 
			(not understanding)
		Right.
  
 
		Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome,
		I am Baron Lando Calrissian,
		Administrator of this facility ...
		and who might you be?
 
		You may call me Leia.
 
 
		And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg
		relations, at your ...
   
 
		She's traveling with me, Lando
		and I don't intend to gamble her 
		away, so you might as well forget
		she exists.
  
 
		That won't be easy, my friend ...
		What brings you here, anyway?
 
		Repairs ...
 
			(mock panic)
		What have you done to my ship?
 
 
		Lando used to own the Falcon.  And
		he sometimes forgets that he lost
		it fair and square.
  
 
		That ship saved my life a few
		times.  It's the fastest hunk of
		machinery in the galaxy.
			(to Han)
		What's wrong with her?
 
		Hyperdrive.
 
		I'll have my people get to work
		on it right away.  Hate the thought
		of the Millennium Falcon without
		her heart. 
    
 
		How's your mining operation going?
 
		Not as well as I'd like.  We're
		a small outpost and not very self-
		sufficient.  I've had supply
		problems of every kind and ...
			(catches Han grinning at him)
		What's so funny?
 
		Nothing.  I never would have
		guessed that underneath that
		wild schemer I knew was a respon-
		sible leader and businessman ...
		But you wear it well.
 
 
		Seeing you sure brings back a
		few things ...
			(shakes his head)
		Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
		It's the price of success.  And
		you know what, Han, you were
		right all along.  It's over-rated.
    
 
 
		Oh, an R-2 unit, I'd almost
		forgotten what they sound like ...
   
 
		Oh my! ... Those look like ...
    
     
      
     
      
 
		Be calm.  Through The Force, things
		you will see: other places, other
		thoughts, the future, the past,
		old friends long gone.
 
		How's the boy doing?
 
		A most gifted apprentice ... if
		concentrate he would!
 
 
		Ben?  Ben?
 
		Free your mind and return he will.
 
		My mind fills with so many images.
 
		Control, control you must learn
		of what you see.  Not easy, not
		fast.
 
		I see a city in the clouds.
 
		Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends
		you have there, heh?  Concentrate
		and see them you will.
 
		I see them! ... They're in pain ...
		they're suffering.
 
		It is the future you see.
   
 
		Will they die?
 
		Difficult to see.  Always in
		motion is the future ... Back
		away, little machine!
    
 
		They're my friends.
 
		Foreknowledge is helpful, but
		painful sometimes and dangerous
		too.  You have far to go in your 
		training.
    
      
      
    
 
		What are you staring at?
 
			(ga-ga)
		Who's staring?
 
		You look silly.
 
		You look great.
 
			(embarrassed)
		Has Threepio turned up yet?
 
		Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone
		too long just to be lost.  He may
		have gotten into some trouble.
		Chewie went to look for him.
			(he pats a spot on his lounge)
		Come over here.  I want to check
		this out.
    
 
		I hope Luke made it to the fleet
		all right.
 
		Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably
		sitting around wondering what we're
		doing right now.
    
 
		Barks at his master.
 
		What happened?
 
		He found him in a junk pile ...
 
		Something's wrong here.  Your
		friend Lando is very charming,
		but I don't trust him.
 
		Well, I do trust him.  Lando's
		an old friend.  Must have been
		an accident.
 
		Chewie, do you think you can repair
		him?
  
 
		Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
 
		Why don't we just turn him over 
		to Lando to fix?
 
		No thanks.
 
		Look, sweetheart, I'm not going
		to have you accusing my friend of ...
  
 
		Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
 
		Not really.
 
		I must say, your beauty is unpar-
		alleled.  Truly you belong here
		with us among the clouds.
 
			(icy)
		Thanks.
 
		Would you care to join me for a
		little refreshment?
 
 
		Barks at the mention of food.
		Licks his lips.
 
		Everyone's invited, of course.
  
 
		Having problems with you droid?
 
 
		An accident.  Nothing we can't
		handle.
   
   
 
		.... We are a free station and do
		not fall under the jurisdiction
		of the Empire.
 
		You're part of the mining guild
		then?
 
		Not actually .... Our operation
		is small enough not to be noticed,
		so you might say we're enterprisers.
		Most of our trade is, well ...
		unofficial. 
  
  
 
		It's a lovely outpost.
 
		Yes, we keep pollution down by 
		having the power reactor far below
		the city.  It's connected by a
		transfer shaft. 
  
 
		Barks at Han.
 
		Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't
		you afraid the Empire might
		discover this little operation
		and shut you down?
 
		That's always been the danger.
		It's loomed like a shadow over
		everything we've built here.  But
		circumstances have developed
		which will insure security.  You
		see, I've just made a deal that
		will keep the Empire out of here
		forever ... 
     
 
		Sorry friend, I had no choice.
		They arrived right before you
		did.
 
		I'm sorry too.
        
 
		I'm glad you could join us.  have
		some nourishment, for it will
		be your last meal. 
        
              
         
 
			(to Yoda)
		I can't keep the vision out of
		my head ... My friends ... they're
		in trouble ... I feel that ...
  
 
		... Luke, you must not go.
 
		But Han and Leia will surely die.
 
		You don't know that.  Even I
		cannot see their fate.
 
		I can help them!
 
		You're not ready yet.  You still
		have much to learn.
 
		I feel The Force.
 
		But you cannot control it.  This
		is a dangerous time for you, Luke.
		You are now most susceptible to
		the temptations of the dark side.
 
		Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen
		young one.  The tree.  Remember 
		your failure at the tree!  Heh?
 
		I've learned so much since then.  And
		I'll return to finish ... I promise
		that, master.
 
		Will you?  You underestimate The
		Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that
		is why your friends suffer.
 
		And that is why I must go.
 
		Luke, I will not lose you to the 
		Emperor, as I lost Vader.
 
		You won't.
 
		Only a fully trained Jedi Knight,
		with The Force as his ally, will
		conquer Vader and his Emperor.
		If you end your training now, if
		you choose the quick and easy path
		... as Vader did ... you will
		become an agent of evil ... and
		the galaxy will be plunged deeper
		into the abyss of hate, despair
		and pain that you feel your friends
		suffering now.
 
		Stopped they must be.  Do you
		hear?  On this all depends.
 
		You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You
		are our only hope.  Be patient.
 
		And sacrifice Han and Leia?
 
		If it must be.  Yes.
    
 
		I cannot.  Ben, I must go.  Now
		that I can see their suffering,
		I must help ...
      
     
 
		I cannot protect you, Luke.  If
		you choose to face Vader, you 
		will do it alone.  Once you've 
		made this decision, I cannot
		interfere.
 
 
		I understand.
			(to Yoda)
		I'll be back, Master Yoda.  I
		will finish what I have begun
		I give you my word.  Artoo, fire
		up the power converters.
 
		Whistles a happy reply.
 
		Luke, use The Force only for
		knowledge and for defense, not
		as a weapon.  Don't give in to
		hate or anger or fear ... they
		lead the way to the dark side ... 
 
		Strong is Vader.  Clouded is
		your fate.  Mind what you have 
		learned ... Notice everything,
		everything!  It can save you.
 
		I will, master, I will!
  
 
		Told you, I did.  Reckless is he
		... Now things are going to worse.
 
		The boy is our last hope.
 
		No ... there is another. 
   
  
      
 
		Barks a few remarks of a philoso-
		phical nature.
      
 
		Immmm-peer-eee-alll-storrr-mmmm-
		trooo ...
   
 
		Stormtroopers!  Help!  Oh, my
		head ... Where am I?
 
 
		Chewbacca!  Watch out, there are
		Imperial Stormtroopers hidden in
		... Oh no, I've been shot! 
    
 
		Bounty hunter, if you are waiting
		for your reward, you will wait
		until I have Skywalker.
 
			(a very tough customer)
		I am in no hurry, Lord Vader.  My
		concern is that Captain Solo not
		be damaged.  The reward from
		Jabba the Hutt pays double if
		he's alive.
 
		His pain is considerable, bounty
		hunter, but he will not be harmed.
 
		What about Leia and the Wookiee?
 
		You will find them well enough.
		But they must never again leave
		this city.
 
		That was never mentioned.  Neither
		was this bounty hunter taking Han.
		I hope you haven't forgotten our
		bargain.
 
		I forget nothing, Calrissian.
		Perhaps you think you're being
		treated unfairly.
 
			(glances at his aide)
		No.
 
		Good.  It would be most unfortunate
		if I had to leave a permanent
		garrison here.
   
 
		This deal's getting worse all
		the time.
 
		Maybe you should have argued with
		him.
  
 
			(finally)
		I've got a bad feeling about this. 
     
 
		Well, something's not right because
		now I can't see.
			(Chewie barks and
				adjusts a wire)
		There now, that's better, wait ...
		Oh, my.  What have you done?  I'm
		backwards!  You flea-bitten furball!
		Only an overgrown mophead like you
		would be stupid enough to put my
		head ...
       
 
		Barks his concern.
 
		No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
     
 
		I was worried about you.
 
		I'm worried about all of us.  I
		can't figure out what they're up
		to.
 
		Me either.  They had me howling
		on the scan grid, but they never
		asked me any questions.
  
 
		Get out of here, Lando!
 
		Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm
		doing what I can to make this
		easier for you.
 
		This ought to be good.
 
		Vader agreed to turn Leia and
		Chewie over to me.  They'll have
		to stay here, but at least they'll
		be safe.
 
		What about Han?
 
			(to Han)
		I didn't know you had a price on
		your head.  Vader has given you
		to the bounty hunter.
 
 
		You don't know much about much if
		you think Vader won't want us dead
		before this is over.
 
		He doesn't want you at all.  He's
		after someone named Skywalker.
 
		Luke?  I don't get it.
 
 
		Lord Vader has set a trap for
		him and ...
 
		... we're the bait.
 
		All this just to get the kid?
		What's so important about him?
 
		Don't ask me, but he's on his 
		way.
 
		Luke's coming here?
 
 
		You fixed us all pretty good ...
			(spits it out)
		... friend!
      
 
		Don't shoot!  I've done what I
		can for you.  I'm sorry it's not
		better, but I've got my own
		problems.
			(turns to leave)
		I've already stuck my neck out
		further than I should ...
 
		Yeah, you're a real hero.
   
 
			(dabs at his wound)
		You certainly have a way with people. 
   
   
 
		Yes, I'm sure Threepio is with them.
			(Artoo whistles excitedly)
		Just hold on, we'll be there soon. 
  
    
 
		The facility is crude, but it
		should suit our needs.
 
 
		We have a ship approaching of
		the X wing class.
 
		Good.  Monitor Skywalker's
		progress and allow him to land.
		We'll have the chamber ready 
		for him shortly.
 
		We only use this chamber for
		carbon freezing.  If you put him
		in there, it'll kill him.
 
		I think not.  But I don't wish
		my prize to be damaged.  We'll 
		test it first.
			(to a Stormtrooper)
		Bring in Captain Solo.
  
   
 
 
			(to Artoo)
		You haven't picked up any patrol
		ships?
 
		Beeps a ÒnegativeÓ which prints 
		out on a panel. 
          
		to the Wookiee's back.  His legs and other arm 
 
 
		I'll make your goods easier for
		you to transport.  Put Captain
		Solo in the zero-cold chamber.
 
		But the chamber is for power
		goods.  What if he doesn't survive?
		This slime is worth a lot to me ...
 
		The Empire will pay for the loss.
		Bring him forward!
 
		No!
      
 
		Wait!  What are you doing? ...
		Oh, no ... Don't hit me!  No!  He
		doesn't mean it! ... Calm down,
		you hairy fool! ... Ouch!  I
		didn't do anything ...
 
 
		Chewie, no!  Stop it, Chewbacca!
  
 
		Oh, yes ... stop, stop.  Thank
		heavens ...
 
 
		Save your strength for another
		time, Chewie, when the odds are
		better.
 
 
		Barks a doleful farewell.
 
		I'm sure I'll see you again, too.
		Keep well.
			(turns to guard)
		You'd better chain him until it's
		over.
    
 
		... I love you.  I couldn't tell
		you before, but it's true.
 
		... just remember that, Ôcause
		I'll be back ...
    
       
     
 
		They're encasing him in carbonite.
		It's high quality alloy.  Much
		better than my own.  He should
		be quite well protected ... if
		he survived the freezing process.
  
     
 
		He's alive and in perfect hibernation.
 
		He's all yours, bounty hunter.
		Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
 
		He's just landed, My Lord.
 
		See to it that he finds his way
		here.
 
		I'll take what's mine now.
 
		Take them, but I'm keeping a
		detachment of troops here to
		watch over them.
 
		That wasn't the bargain.  You
		said the Empire wouldn't interfere
		in--
 
		I'm altering the bargain.  Pray
		I don't alter it any further.
   
     
         
     
 
		Leia!
 
		Luke, no!  It's a trap.
    
         
    
   
 
		I know you're with me, Lord Vader,
		I can feel your presence.  Show
		yourself, or do you fear me?
  
 
		The Force is with you young Skywalker,
		but you are not a Jedi yet. 
    
 
		Code force seven.
    
 
		Hold them in the north tower.
		Quietly!  No one must know.
 
 
		What's going on?
 
		I'm coming over to your side,
		that's what.  And I have a feeling
		I'm making a big mistake.
 
		And when do you betray us again?
  
 
		Look, I stand to lose everything
		by this.
 
		We have no use for your kind.
 
		This is no time to be choosy,
		honey.  What do you say we debate
		this later?  There's still a
		chance I can get you out of here.
 
		Barks a blue streak.
 
		What's wrong with him?
 
			(Very worried)
		Oh my.  Oh no.  He's not interested
		in escape.  He wants to go after
		Captain Solo .... Artoo!!
     
 
		Wait!  Where'd he go?  Turn
		around, you woolly ... Ah, Artoo!
 
 
		Beeps a wild series of exclamations
		about his friend's condition.
 
		Don't ask.
 
		Chewie's right.  We must try to
		save Han.
 
			(thinking fast)
		There's not much chance, but the
		bounty hunter's ship is on the
		East Landing Platform.
 
 
		Beeps wildly.
 
		I'm afraid Lord Vader has Master
		Luke.  There's no hope of saving
		him. 
    
 
		The fear does not reach you.  You
		have learned more than I anticipated.
 
		You'll find I'm full of surprises.
 
		And I too.
    
 
		Your future lies with us, Skywalker.
		Now you will embrace the dark side.
		Obi-wan knew this to be true.
 
		No!
 
		There is much Obi-wan did not
		tell you.  Come, The Emperor will
		complete your training.
 
		I'll die first.
 
		That won't be necessary.
    
 
		All too easy.  Perhaps you are 
		not as strong as The Emperor
		thought.
 
		Time will tell.
      
 
		Your agility is impressive.  Let's
		see what other skills you've learned.
   
 
		I feel it now ... your fear, your
		anger.  Good.  Let The Force flow.
		Hate me.  I'm the one who destroyed
		your family.
   
 
		Attack.  Take your revenge.
		Destroy me.
    
 
		There is no escape.  You will use
		the dark side of The Force ... or
		perish.  Let your hate flow and
		save yourself.
  
   
 
		Seal it. 
    
   
 
 
		It's no use, they're out of range.
 
		Oh my, no!
    
 
		Come on, let's move!
         
 
		Artoo, help me!  How did I get
		into this? ... What a fate worse
		than death is to be strapped to
		the back of a Wookiee!
 
		Get in here!  Now!  Both of you,
		hurry up!
    
  
 
		You're nuts!
 
		With all respect, I'm tempted to
		agree ...
 
		We should have stayed and finished
		them off.
 
		Barks his agreement.
 
		You two almost signed off out there.
 
		Three!  I count three of us ...
 
		I don't care.  It would've been
		worth it .... for Han.
 
		Barks his Òright on!Ó
 
		Very noble.  Not smart, but
		noble.
 
		You've probably never done an
		honorable thing in your life.
 
		Sure I did ... once.  It turned
		out lousy.
 
		What chance have we got in here?
		What are we going to do when they
		cut ...
  
 
		... the power?
 
		Howls.
 
		Whistles. 
       
       
 
		You are beaten.  It is useless to
		resist.
    
 
		Don't let yourself be destroyed
		as Obi-wan did.
   
 
			(to himself)
		Knowledge and defense.
    
    
 
		You will join me, or you will
		join Obi-wan in death!
      
      
 
		You'd better know what you're
		doing, or this is going to get
		very messy.
 
			(completely dumbfounded)
		Don't worry about a thing.  I'll
		get us going. 
   
 
		Artoo can release the brakes
		through the central controls.
  
 
		Then do it!  They're breaking in!
 
		Beeps a snappy okay.
    
  
 
		Reverse!  Stop it!  Stop! 
 
 
		Oh my, he's lost contact. 
     
      
            
     
 
		Fugitives heading for transport
		Platform Southwest-One.  Secure
		all transport.
 
		Your friends may escape, but you
		are doomed.
 
		Not yet.
        
         
 
		We've got to find Luke.
 
		His fate is sealed.  You'll be
		lucky to get out yourself.  All
		systems are on alert.  everything's
		locked.
 
		Artoo!  The control panel.  You
		can override the alert system.
   
 
		A short beep turns into a wild
		scream!
  
 
			(cooling away)
		Lets out a few wilted beeps.
 
		Well, next time you pay more
		attention.  I'm not supposed to
		know power sockets from computer
		feeds, I'm an interpreter ...
 
			(firing at the Stormtroopers)
		Anybody else got any ideas? 
            
 
		The Force runs strong in the
		Skywalker line.  You will achieve
		great power ... Come, join with
		me!  Together we will be the most 
		powerful ... even stronger than
		The Emperor.

		(INSERT B - DIALOGUE ADDED HERE)
 
		No! .... Never ....
  
 
		There is no escape.  You must
		join me or die.  Don't make me
		destroy you here ... The Emperor
		is strong with The Force.  But
		if you join me, together we could
		overthrow Him.  Do not resist.
		It is our destiny!
 
		Never.
      
 
		Never!
  
 
		No!
     
      
    
   
    
  
    
 
		Leia, Leia .... Leia, I need you.
  
     
 
		This is Baron Calrissian.  The
		Empire is taking control of the
		city.  Evacuate immediately.
		Leave before more Imperial troops
		arrive.
    
 
		Artoo, you did it!  I never
		doubted you for a second ...
 
		Let's go.
   
      
    
 
		Leia .... Leia ....
     
     
 
		What'd you say?
 
		I didn't say anything?
  
  
 
		Save your fire, the patrol ships
		will get them. 
   
  
 
    
 
		Leia, help.  Please, Leia.  Hear me. 
   
  
 
		I knew that set-up was too good
		to last .... I'm going to miss it.
 
		Luke!
 
		What?
 
		Luke needs help.  We must go back.
 
		Barks his consternation.
 
		Chewie, head for the bottom of
		the city.
 
		Three patrol ships are heading 
		our way.
 
		Barks an argument and shakes his
		head.
 
		No argument, just do it.  That's 
		a command!
 
		Wait a minute.  We're not going
		back there.
 
		Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with
		an ominous growl.
 
		Okay, okay. 
   
   
   
 
		Beeps some news.
 
		Turning around?  Oh, no!  I knew
		we'd never escape ... 
     
  
 
		Someone's falling.
 
		It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow
		down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your 
		tracking system.  Lando, open the
		hatch. 
   
 
 
		Slower, Chewie, slower. 
     
      
   
   
   
 
		The hatch is closed.  Full speed.
		Two more ships are closing.
 
 
		Lando, is he alright? ... Lando?
		Are you there?  How's Luke?
 
		He'll survive.
    
 
		Howls.
 
			(climbs into the co-pilot's seat)
		We're not out of this yet.
  
   
   
   
 
		The deflector shields are gone.
 
			(to Chewie)
		Are the coordinates set?
 
 
		This hyperdrive had better work.
 
		I've never seen it fail.
 
 
		I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've
		got nothing to worry about.
 
		That sounds familiar.
 
 
		Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
 
		Barks his agreement.
   
   
   
    
  
   
     
        
    
 
		I want to go with them, but I
		have a promise to keep.  They'll
		find Han.  I know they will ...
